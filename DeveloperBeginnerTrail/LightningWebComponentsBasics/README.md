### Explain the Lightning Web Components programming model
The Lightning Web Components (capitalized) programming model is built on modern web standardsâ€”using standard **HTML** (provides the structure for your component), **ES6+ JavaScript** (defines the core business logic and event handling), and **CSS** (provides the look, feel, and animation for your component). Lightning Web Components uses core [Web Components](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents) standards and provides only what's necessary to perform well in browsers supported by Salesforce. You create components with just a JavaScript file, an HTML template, and (optionally) a CSS file, and Salesforce compiles and renders them efficiently.
