This README summarizes  units from the [Multirecord Elements and Transforms in Flows](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/multirecord-elements-and-transforms-in-flows?trail_id=build-flows-with-flow-builder) Trailhead module.

# [1. Update and Retrieve Multiple Records](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/multirecord-elements-and-transforms-in-flows/update-and-retrieve-multiple-records?trail_id=build-flows-with-flow-builder)

### Installing a package on a Trailhead Playground
1. Open your playground,
2. Click **Install a package** tab,
3. Insert Package ID, click **Install**.

### How to create a record-triggered flow
1. Click **Setup**,
2. Select object from **Object Manager** tab,
3. Click **Flow Triggers** > **New Flow**.

### Otherwise (how to find Flow Builder)
1. **Navigate to Setup**: Click on the gear icon in the top right corner and select "Setup",
2. **Search for Flow**: In the Quick Find box, type "Flows",
3. **Open Flow Builder**: Click on "Flows" under the Process Automation section. From there, you can create a new flow by clicking the "New Flow" button.
(Remember you may need to create some resources like variables etc. You can do this clicking **New Resource** on a left).

### Updating Multiple Related Records
In a record-triggered flow (e.g., when an Opportunity closes lost), use a single **Update Records** element—configured via *Update Related Records*—to automatically update all related records, such as open Cases linked to the same Account.
Key points:
* Apply filters (e.g., only update Cases where Status ≠ Closed),
* Avoid per-record loops—this single-action approach is efficient and avoids hitting governor limits.

### Fetching Multiple Records with Collection Variables
A Get Records element can retrieve multiple records (e.g., all onboarding steps for a Project) and store them in a **record collection variable**.
* Collection variables hold multiple records of the same object type,
* Choosing “All records” + “Automatically store all fields” in Get Records results in a full collection.

# [2. Transform Multiple Records](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/multirecord-elements-and-transforms-in-flows/transform-multiple-records?trail_id=build-flows-with-flow-builder)

### Transforms vs. Loops
Flow Builder provides two elements you can use to change every record in a collection together:
* **A Transform element** copies the values of one or more components or variables (single or collection) to an autogenerated variable, while also changing the copy’s finalized values,
* **A Loop element** iterates through multiple values in a collection, one at a time, allowing the flow to run each of those values through a series of elements.
**Transforms** are typically **10× faster** and more scalable, making them the preferred choice for bulk operations. Use loops only when transforms can’t handle the logic required.
